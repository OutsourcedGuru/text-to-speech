Create an audio-only interface for reading books from the Gutenberg project suitable for implementation on a Raspberry Pi Zero W single-board computer (with BlueTooth headphones)

## Status
The project currently has five books downloaded, the first several in the books array.

## Complications
Some browsers like Safari now block audio/video content from automatically playing as the default setting. You will need to toggle this off for your own test website.

## Exit criteria
* Refer to `books.json` for **id**s represented
* Exercise the routes given in Express to review the interface, noting that the up/down buttons don't change the page navigation; simply enter a different URL to test each route
* Finish the generator function in `read.js` to make this functional
